# Design the project

Software applications have evolved into a composition of multiple interrelated components to be able to handle increasing complexities. When the number and/or depth of such components grow, it is convenient to have a high-level picture of the system components and their interactions. 

The Architecture View of the Ballerina VS Code extension provides a high-level picture of the components and their interactions in Ballerina projects purely based on the source code. The topics below demonstrates the Architecture View in detail.
