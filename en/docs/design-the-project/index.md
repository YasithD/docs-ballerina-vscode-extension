# Design the project

Software applications have evolved into a composition of multiple interrelated components to handle increasing complexities. When the number and/or depth of such components grow, it is convenient to have a high-level picture of the system components and their interactions. 

The architecture diagram of the Ballerina VS Code extension provides a high-level picture of Ballerina projects purely based on the source code. The sections below demonstrates the Architecture View in detail.
