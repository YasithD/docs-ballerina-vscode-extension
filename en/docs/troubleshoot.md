# Troubleshoot

You can troubleshoot Ballerina VS Code extension use cases by viewing Ballerina output.

To view the Ballerina output tab, click **View**, click **Output**, and select **Ballerina** from the output list. It provides additional information if the plugin fails to detect a Ballerina distribution.

You can also enable [debug logs](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/configure-the-extension/#advanced-configurations) from the Ballerina extension settings to view any issues arising from the extension features.
