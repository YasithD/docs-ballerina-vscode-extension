Output parameters can also be derived by aggregating multiple input parameters.

!!! Info
    To aggregate fields, you can map two or more fields to the same output field. The Data Mapper will automatically combine the two fields and assign them to the output field. By default, the fields will be combined with a plus operator. If you want to use a different operator or method to combine two fields, click the **Code** button and customize the expression using the expression editor.
