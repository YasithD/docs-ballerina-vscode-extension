To map fields, select an input field first, then choose the corresponding output field.

!!! Info
    The mapping view will have the **Inputs** on the left-hand side of the UI and the **Output** on the right. To map the fields, click on the input field and then, click the output field. If the input and output fields are compatible and can be mapped directly, you will see a solid line connecting them.
