### Basic mapping

Map the `person id` to the `student id` as shown below.

!!! Info
    The mapping view will have the **Inputs** on the left-hand side of the UI and the **Output** on the right. To map the fields, click on the input field and then, click the output field. If the input and output fields are compatible and can be mapped directly, you will see a solid line connecting them.
