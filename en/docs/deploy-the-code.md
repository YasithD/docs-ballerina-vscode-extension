# Deploy the code

You can manage your Ballerina projects by deploying them in [WSO2 Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/). The integration of the [Choreo VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.choreo) with the Ballerina VS Code extension enables this functionality. 

For detailed information, see the [WSO2 Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-using-vs-code/).
